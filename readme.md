==============

This is a plugin to strip out all the crap from Peops XGL plugin.

This repo isn't intended for the general public, it's just for developers to look around and fork

Please send in pull requests and issues (and fork!)

Todo
====

• Figure out how to do offscreen hardware rendering (currently uses a software fallback)

• Use integer, not floating point calculations (floating point hacks == bugs, causes flickering)

• Remove ugly hacks/ugly code

• Don't use old OpenGL functions

• Reduce usage of casts

• Remove unused variables/functions
